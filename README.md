## Install PySC2 pip package
This package provides a python client to interact with the Starcraft 2 API.
The package is called *pysc2* and can be installed with:
    
    pip install pysc2

It is best to install the package in a virtual environment, e.g. with *pipenv* to keep all dependencies encapsulated.
